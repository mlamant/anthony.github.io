<h1>Luigi's Mansion vs Luigi's Mansion 3</h1>
<p><strong>My overall opinion</strong> of the Luigi's Mansion series: I actually like the series as a whole because we get to play Luigi, instead of Mario. Unlike the other 
Mario games that take place in "worlds," these takes palce in a haunted mansion. Although there is nothing wrong with the goobmas, koopas, and other enemies, 
the ghosts being the enemies is a nice change of pace. Instead of Bowser, King Boo (a ghost) is the boss. In the other Mario games, Princess Peach would need 
to be rescued by Mario. In the Luigi's Mansion series, Mario would need to be rescued by his younger brother, Luigi. Another detail that both games have, 
(Although the 1st Luigi Mansion does a better job on this), is that both games have a &quot;scary element"&quot; When playing Luigi's Mansion, it does feel &quot;scarier&quot; 
for a kids game. For Luigi's Mansion 3, the "scary" element is tone down.</p>
