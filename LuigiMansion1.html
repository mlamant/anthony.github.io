<h1>Luigi's Mansion</h1>
<p><strong>My overall opinion</strong> of Luigi's Mansion: I think this was a great game. Although one drawback in my opinion, is that this game is a little short. I really wish that Nintendo
extended this game. Although there was other positive points to make that I am willing to overlook this particular drawback. In this game, Luigi is the main protagnist, not his
older brother, Mario. Supporting characters that appear in this game are the toads and a scientist name Profoessor E. Gadd. The boss ghosts in this game are unique. From a father, mother,
baby, twins brothers, a sister, a dog, a pianist, an artist, and so on. Another cool part in this game is the scary element. When I played this game as a kid, I would feel scared. Comparing
this game to its two sequels, this game has the scarier element than the other two. One interesting detail I did not notice is that out of all of the ghosts boss, only one does not threatened
Luigi. I think the "unused content" are more interesting to see. Some unused content for this game were an unused multiplayer mode, what would ghost look like before the final game, the
Poltergust 3000 (Luigi's vacuum) earlier appearance, ghost scaring Luigi would make his health go down by 50 then go back up to 100, and earlier functions of the Game Boy Horror (a tool Luigi uses).</p>
