<h1>Luigi's Mansion 3</h1>
<p><strong>My overall opinion</strong> of Luigi's Mansion 3: I think this was a good game. Unlike it's predecessor (Luigi's Mansion Dark Moon), you can keep going to next mission, instead of
going back to Professor E. Gadd base. This time, that is optional. Also unlike the 2 predecssors games, Luigi not only has to save Mario, but Luigi has to also save the toads,
Professor E. Gadd, and Princess Peach. With Luigi exploring the hotel and finding a way to save his friends, he has a tool called the Poltergust G-00 and a companion name Gooigi.
Playing Gooigi game actually fun. Playing against the 15 ghosts boss was cool because each ghost felt unique. Similar to Luigi Mansion Dark Moon, gems return. Also returning from the two
games are boos as well as bills and coins. For thr 17 floors, each floor was unique and cool. From a shopping like setting, a movie set, resturant, garden like setting, gym, and a dance like setting.
The only friendly ghost in this game is Luigi's pet name Polterpup.</p>
